# data-augmentation-with-numpy

implementing various image augmentation techniques using Numpy. The project acknowledges that these techniques are already available in different libraries, with better implementations, and therefore does not claim to have reinvented the wheel. Instead, the aim was to gain knowledge in implementing these techniques. As a result, no benchmarking was conducted. Albumentations served as a source of inspiration for the techniques to implement and for the documentation. The implemented methods include AddGaussianNoise, ChangeBrightness, ColorModification, Crop, Flip, Flip Horizontal, Flip Vertical, RandomCrop, Rotate, Translation, TranslationX, TranslationY, and Zoom. For more advanced and optimized implementations, other libraries are recommended
